# iSIN-Code-Retriever

Overview

This project is a Python desktop application that retrieves ISIN codes for listed commodity options based on contract characteristics.
The tool allows users to select a product, maturity, option type and strike price, and returns the corresponding ISIN from a structured dataset.
The ISIN is then copied directly to the clipboard for immediate use.

How It Works:

Select a product
-Available maturities are filtered automatically
-Option types and strikes update dynamically
-Click Validate to retrieve the ISIN
-The ISIN is copied to the clipboard
